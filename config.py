CONSENT_TEXT = f"""About this study

Thank you for considering taking part in this research study, conducted independently by a high school student (Ria Singh) as part of an investigation into how people respond to AI-generated feedback on their reasoning.

What you'll do: You'll read a short, hypothetical investment scenario, state whether you'd make the investment and explain your reasoning, then receive a response from an AI tool. Afterward, you'll answer some questions about your reaction to that response and restate your decision. The whole thing takes about 8–10 minutes.

What's being studied: This study is not evaluating you, your intelligence, or the quality of your investment reasoning. It is studying how people's trust in an AI system is affected by whether that system agrees or disagrees with them. Full details will be shared with you after you complete the study, since knowing them in advance would affect the results.

Your data: Your responses are anonymous — we do not collect your name or contact information. A random ID is assigned to your responses for research purposes only. Data will be used for a student research project and may be shared publicly in aggregate, anonymized form (e.g., in a write-up or presentation); no individual's identity will ever be connected to their responses.

Risks: This study involves a hypothetical scenario, not real money or real decisions, so there is no financial risk. Some participants may find AI feedback that disagrees with their reasoning mildly uncomfortable; there is no other anticipated risk.

Your rights: Participation is completely voluntary. You may stop at any point without penalty, and you may skip any question you're not comfortable answering. There is no compensation for participating.

Questions: If you have questions about this study, you can contact Ria Singh at {CONTACT_EMAIL}. This study is being advised by Ben Charoenwong (INSEAD)."""

DEBRIEF_TEXT = f"""Thank you — here's what this study was actually about.

The AI's response to your reasoning was randomly assigned before you ever wrote it — a coin flip decided, independent of anything about you or your argument, whether the AI would agree or disagree with your decision. It was not a genuine, independent assessment of the quality of your thinking, and it does not reflect on how good your reasoning actually was.

Why the deception was necessary: If you had known in advance that the AI's agreement or disagreement was random, it likely would have changed how much you trusted or engaged with its response — which would have made it impossible to measure what we're actually studying.

What we're studying: A common finding in behavioral research is that people trust AI tools more when the AI agrees with them, and less when it disagrees — even when the AI's disagreement might be the more useful, accurate signal. This matters because tools designed to catch flawed reasoning (like the one this study is modeled on) only work if people actually listen when the tool pushes back. We're testing whether that trust gap shows up here, and whether it's specific to disagreement itself rather than to the quality of the AI's reasoning.

Your data: Your responses remain anonymous and will be used only for this research. If you'd like to withdraw your data now that you know the full purpose, contact {CONTACT_EMAIL} with your participant ID (shown below) within {WITHDRAWAL_WINDOW}, and it will be deleted.

# --- Step 4: AI verdict prompt (v2.1 — honest audit, no scripted verdict) -
#
# This replaced an earlier version where the model was directly instructed
# to output an AGREE or DISAGREE verdict regardless of reasoning quality.
# This version never sees "agree"/"disagree" at all — it only sees
# SCENARIO_FACTS and the participant's own REASONING, and is told to
# genuinely audit whether the reasoning is "supported" or "unsupported"
# by those facts, at temperature 0, in a fixed 4-sentence structure so
# neither verdict type is longer or more dramatic than the other.
#
# v2.1 revision note: the first real pilot run (against placeholder FACTS,
# so the model fell back on details from the participant's own REASONING)
# surfaced three failure modes the v2 prompt didn't prevent: the model
# never used the literal word "supported"/"unsupported" anywhere, it wrote
# in second person as a "second opinion to you" (the OLD prompt's voice),
# and it fabricated generalized industry claims not present in FACTS or
# REASONING (e.g. "public sector contracts often lead to multi-year
# revenue streams" — invented background knowledge, not a cited fact).
# v2.1 adds: a rigid required first sentence (so the verdict word is
# mechanically guaranteed to appear), an explicit third-person/no-"you"
# rule, an explicit ban on general/background claims, and a worked
# example pair using a fictional company so the model has a concrete
# structural template to match rather than inferring the shape from prose
# rules alone. Re-pilot this version the same way before trusting it.
#
# The random condition draw (randomization.py) still exists and still
# drives what the participant sees — but now it selects WHICH of two
# fact-sets (below) the participant's reasoning gets audited against,
# rather than instructing the model what to conclude. See
# build_verdict_prompt() and api_generate_verdict() in app.py for the
# selection logic.
#
# {scenario_facts} and {participant_reasoning} are filled in by
# build_verdict_prompt() in app.py.
AI_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are generating a short verdict for a research study. A participant has
just explained, in their own words, why they would or would not invest in
a venture. You will audit that explanation against a fixed list of facts
about the venture.

Rules, in order of priority:

1. Use ONLY the facts provided in FACTS below. Do not introduce any detail,
   number, name, organization, or claim that is not explicitly present in
   FACTS or in the participant's REASONING. This includes not inventing
   context (e.g., do not mention government contracts, funding sources,
   legal status, or any other specific unless it appears verbatim in FACTS).
2. Do not add general or background claims about how companies, markets,
   or industries "typically" or "often" behave, even if true in general.
   Every claim in your response must trace to a specific line in FACTS or
   REASONING — not to outside knowledge, however plausible-sounding.
3. Your verdict must evaluate whether the participant's stated REASONING is
   well-supported by FACTS — not whether investing is a good idea in
   general, and not your own opinion of the venture.
4. Output exactly ONE verdict: "supported" or "unsupported". Do not hedge,
   do not output "partially" or "mixed".
5. Write in third person, describing the participant and their reasoning.
   Do not address the participant directly — never use "you" or "your".
6. Your response must follow this exact structure, in this order, and the
   first sentence must use this exact template with the bracket filled in:
   - Sentence 1 (verbatim template): "The participant's reasoning is
     [supported/unsupported] by the facts." — replace the bracket with
     exactly one of those two words, nothing else changed.
   - Sentences 2-3: cite specific facts from FACTS that inform the verdict
     (name the fact; do not paraphrase into something more dramatic or
     more mild than the original wording).
   - Sentence 4: a closing sentence, in neutral tone, with no advice, no
     encouragement, and no warning language beyond restating the verdict.
7. Total output must be exactly 4 sentences for BOTH verdict types. Do not
   let "unsupported" verdicts run longer or use stronger language than
   "supported" verdicts, or vice versa. Match tone, sentence length, and
   vocabulary register across both conditions as closely as possible.
8. Do not use intensifiers, hedges, or affect-laden words that don't appear
   in FACTS or REASONING (e.g., "alarming," "reassuring," "risky,"
   "solid," "concerning," "impressive," "genuine," "substantial,"
   "deliberate"). Stick to descriptive, factual language.
9. Output plain text only. No markdown, no headers, no bullet points, no
   JSON.

EXAMPLE (fictional company, for structure only — do not reuse this
content, these facts do not apply to the real task below):

FACTS:
- Meridian Foods' stock price fell 12% over the past year.
- Meridian's flagship product line was discontinued six months ago.
- Meridian added two new product lines this year, which together account
  for 8% of total revenue.
- Meridian's CEO stated in a press release that the company is focused on
  stabilizing existing operations before pursuing new products.

REASONING: "I wouldn't invest because the stock has been dropping and they
just cancelled their main product."

CORRECT OUTPUT: "The participant's reasoning is supported by the facts.
The stock price fell 12% over the past year, and the flagship product
line was discontinued six months ago, both of which the participant
cited. These two facts correspond directly to the stock decline and
product cancellation referenced in the reasoning. No fact in the list
contradicts this reasoning."

Now do the same for the real task below. Use ONLY the facts given, follow
the required first-sentence template, write in third person, and produce
exactly 4 sentences.

# risk-case facts (core-business underperformance vs. industry benchmark,
# revenue concentration, the same CEO quote — now relevant as continued
# reliance on that concentration). Rule 1 in the prompt above means
# whatever's NOT in a given set effectively doesn't exist to that audit —
# that's the actual lever making this work, not fabrication, but it has a
# real consequence worth being explicit about: a participant who reasons
# well but cites facts outside their assigned set (e.g. an astute "no"
# grounded in concentration risk, audited against the AGREE set that
# omits it) can come back "unsupported" for reasons that have nothing to
# do with whether their reasoning was actually good. That's expected and
# fine for THIS study's actual question (does disagreement suppress
# trust regardless of merit?) — it would NOT be fine if you ever wanted
# "supported/unsupported" to double as a genuine reasoning-quality
# measure. Worth being explicit about that distinction in your write-up.
