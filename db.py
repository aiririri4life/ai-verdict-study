"""
Data model — one table, one row per participant, columns added as the
participant moves through the steps.

Why one wide table instead of several linked ones: this is a fixed-length
survey (no repeating sections), so a normalized schema would just add joins
without adding correctness. One row per participant also makes the CSV
export in app.py trivial — it's the table, unmodified.

STORAGE: uses libsql (SQLite-compatible) via the `libsql` package, not the
stdlib `sqlite3` module. If TURSO_DATABASE_URL is set, every read/write
goes straight over the network to a remote Turso database — no local file
at all. That's deliberate: Render's free tier wipes local disk on every
redeploy and on spin-down after inactivity, which silently lost real
participant data before this switch. If TURSO_DATABASE_URL is unset (e.g.
local development), it falls back to a local SQLite file so you don't need
a Turso account just to run this on your laptop.

libsql's cursors return plain tuples, not sqlite3's dict-like Row objects
— see _row_to_dict() below, which reconstructs column-name access from
cursor.description so the rest of the codebase can keep doing row["column"].
